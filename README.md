# JSON-RPC Developer Tool
Introducing a specialized JSON-RPC Developer Tool designed to streamline and enhance the debugging of JSON-RPC network requests. It offers real-time insights and detailed analytics, significantly improving development efficiency and reducing time-to-market for JSON-RPC applications.

## Problem to Solve
JSON-RPC developers often face challenges in efficiently debugging and monitoring their network requests due to the lack of specialized tools tailored for JSON-RPC protocols. This results in increased development time and difficulty in diagnosing issues, which is crucial for any application.

## Our Solution
We are developing a JSON-RPC Developer Tool, an intuitive chrome extension devtools panel that is designed to inspect, debug, and visualize JSON-RPC network requests in real-time. The tool will utilize a tech stack including React for the frontend inside a chrome extension. Our innovative approach includes parsing and displaying JSON-RPC requests in a user-friendly format, with added features for filtering and detailed analysis of each request.

## Expected Outcomes
Our MVP aims to provide basic functionalities such as live monitoring of JSON-RPC methods, timing, and success. Stretch goals include advanced filtering options, historical analysis, integration with multiple transport types like MetaMask, http.

## Target Audience
This tool is intended for blockchain developers, smart contract developers, and backend engineers who regularly work with JSON-RPC protocols. It will benefit those in the industry, especially in projects involving Ethereum, or other blockchain technologies that use JSON-RPC and require efficient debugging tools.
